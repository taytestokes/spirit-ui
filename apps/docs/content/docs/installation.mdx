# Installation

Get started with Spirit UI by installing the `@spirit-ui/design-system` package.

After installing the package, add the `ThemeProvider` to root layout of your application.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"

export default function RootLayout({
      children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
        <body>
          <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    )
}
```

Ensure to add the `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the `<html>` element of your root layout. If you don't add
the attribute, you will get hydration mismatch warnings. This property only applies one level deep, so it won't prevent
hydration warnings on other elements.
